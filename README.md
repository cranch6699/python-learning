# python-learning

Here's the roadmap we'll follow:

---

Stage 1: Python Core (Quick Start)

Goal: Be productive in Python within a few days
We'll cover:

Variables, types, operators

Control flow (if, for, while)

Functions (with *args, **kwargs)

Lists, dictionaries, sets, tuples

File I/O

Basic modules and packages

Exceptions and error handling


Project : Command-line To-Do app with file persistence


---

Stage 2: Intermediate Python + OOP

Goal: Build scalable code with classes
We'll cover:

Object-Oriented Programming (classes, inheritance)

Pythonic practices (with, list comprehensions, unpacking)

Modules like datetime, os, pathlib, re

Virtual environments & package management (pip, requirements.txt)


Project Idea: Expense tracker with categories, data saving, and class-based logic


---

Stage 3: Real-World Python

Goal: Work on real apps
We’ll explore:

APIs (consuming with requests, building with Flask or FastAPI)

Web scraping with BeautifulSoup / Selenium

Automation and scripts (e.g., rename files, send emails)

CLI tools with argparse or typer


Project Idea: Web-based dashboard that fetches and displays data from a public API (weather, crypto, etc.)


---

Stage 4: Algorithms + Interview Prep

Goal: Be confident for whiteboard/code interviews
We'll cover:

Sorting, searching, recursion

Data structures: stacks, queues, linked lists, trees, graphs

Problem-solving strategies (sliding window, two pointers, DFS/BFS)

Practice with LeetCode-like problems



---

Stage 5: Advanced Project

Goal: Ship something useful
We’ll plan and build something like:

SaaS web app (FastAPI backend, React/Vite frontend)

REST API with authentication and database (PostgreSQL/SQLite)

GitHub Actions CI/CD

Dockerized deployment



---

Tools:

VS Code + Python extension

GitHub repo per stage

pytest for testing

Jupyter notebooks for algorithm practice (optional)
